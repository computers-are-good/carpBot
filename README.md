# Welcome to CarpBot
This is a self-hosted node.js Discord bot which provides many role playing and economy features. Also, it's very buggy.

## So, what can CarpBot do?
- Earn money by working, buying houses, robbing others, and more!
- Spend your hard-earned money at the shop to buy equipment and consumables.
- Fight monsters in dungeons and get rewards.
- Participate in server-wide boss raids for elusive loot.
- Level up and improve your combat stats.
- Fight other players both in combat and for a spot on the leaderboard.
- And so much more! (Yes, I've ran out of ideas)

## Setting up
I'll do this later.
